# Requirements Document: E-Commerce Customer Analytics Platform

## 1. Project Overview
The E-Commerce Customer Analytics Platform aims to analyze customer purchase behavior, predict churn, segment customers for targeted marketing, and provide actionable insights through an interactive dashboard. The platform uses the UCI Online Retail Dataset and leverages Python, SQL, and visualization tools to deliver data-driven marketing strategies.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Customer Purchase Pattern Analysis
- **Description**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in customer purchase behavior.
- **Features**:
  - Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to visualize purchase distributions (e.g., quantity, price), sales by country, and time-based trends.
  - Implement **RFM Analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to quantify customer value.
  - Perform **Cohort Analysis** to track customer retention and behavior over time.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Generate at least 5 visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar charts, line plots) summarizing purchase patterns.
  - Calculate RFM scores for all customers with >90% data coverage.
  - Produce cohort retention tables for at least 6 months of data.
- **Dependencies**: UCI Online Retail Dataset, Python (pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib).

### 2.2 Churn Prediction
- **Description**: Build a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to churn (stop purchasing).
- **Features**:
  - Use classification models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) to predict churn based on RFM scores and other features (e.g., average order value).
  - Evaluate models using metrics like ROC-AUC, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
  - Provide model interpretability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Achieve ROC-AUC > 0.75 on test data.
  - Generate SHAP summary plots for top 10 features.
- **Dependencies**: Python (scikit-learn, SHAP), cleaned dataset.

### 2.3 Customer Segmentation
- **Description**: Segment customers into distinct groups for targeted marketing campaigns.
- **Features**:
  - Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to group customers based on RFM scores.
  - Visualize clusters using dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) for 2D scatter plots.
  - Profile segments (e.g., "high-value, loyal" vs. "low-frequency").
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Identify 3-5 distinct customer segments.
  - Visualize clusters with >80% separation in PCA plots.
- **Dependencies**: Python (scikit-learn), RFM data.

### 2.4 Interactive Dashboard
- **Description**: Develop a web-based dashboard to display key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights.
- **Features**:
  - Display KPIs: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), churn rate, retention rate.
  - Include interactive visualizations: RFM scatter plots, cohort retention tables, geographic sales maps (using Folium).
  - Support filtering by country, segment, or time period.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Dashboard includes at least 3 KPIs and 3 interactive charts.
  - Visualizations update dynamically based on user input.
- **Dependencies**: Python (Plotly Dash, Folium), Flask API.

### 2.5 A/B Testing Support
- **Description**: Design experiments to test marketing campaign effectiveness (e.g., discount offers).
- **Features**:
  - Provide a framework for A/B test design, including randomization and sample size calculation.
  - Calculate statistical significance of campaign outcomes (e.g., churn reduction).
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Document an A/B test plan with hypothesis, sample size, and metrics.
  - Recommend sample size for detecting a 10% churn reduction with 80% power.
- **Dependencies**: Python (statsmodels), customer data.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Modularity and Scalability
- **Description**: The system should be modular to allow easy addition of new features and scalable to handle larger datasets.
- **Requirements**:
  - Use design patterns (e.g., Factory for model selection, Singleton for database connection).
  - Structure code into layers (data ingestion, processing, API, visualization).
  - Support processing of datasets up to 1 million rows.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Codebase organized into at least 4 distinct modules (e.g., `data_ingestion/`, `models/`).
  - System processes 500,000 rows in <10 minutes on standard hardware (8GB RAM, 4-core CPU).

### 3.2 Dashboard Performance
- **Description**: The dashboard should load quickly to ensure a good user experience.
- **Requirements**:
  - Dashboard initial load time <5 seconds.
  - Interactive updates (e.g., filter changes) <2 seconds.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Measure load time using browser developer tools on localhost.
  - Optimize queries and visualizations for performance.

### 3.3 Data Privacy and Model Fairness
- **Description**: Ensure responsible data use and ethical modeling.
- **Requirements**:
  - Anonymize customer identifiers (e.g., CustomerID) in reports and visualizations.
  - Detect and mitigate bias in churn predictions (e.g., avoid over-targeting high-value customers).
  - Document transparency measures (e.g., SHAP explanations).
- **Success Criteria**:
  - No identifiable customer data in dashboard or outputs.
  - Bias analysis report shows <10% correlation between predictions and sensitive features (e.g., country).
  - Ethics report included in documentation.

## 4. Constraints
- **Dataset**: Limited to UCI Online Retail Dataset (free, no additional data purchases).
- **Tools**: Use open-source tools (Python, SQLite, Plotly Dash) to avoid future costs.
- **Hardware**: Development on standard laptop (8GB RAM, 4-core CPU).

## 5. Assumptions
- The UCI Online Retail Dataset contains sufficient data for RFM, churn, and cohort analysis.
- CustomerID is a reliable unique identifier for customers.
- Churn can be defined as no purchases for 6 months (adjustable based on EDA).

## 6. Deliverables
- Markdown file (`docs/requirements.md`) documenting all requirements.
- System design document (`docs/system_design.md`) mapping requirements to architecture.
- Jupyter Notebooks (`notebooks/eda.ipynb`, `notebooks/model_training.ipynb`) for analysis and prototyping.
- Interactive dashboard (`src/visualization/dashboard.py`) deployed locally.
- A/B test plan (`docs/ab_test_plan.md`) and ethics report (`docs/ethics_report.md`).

## 7. Stakeholders
- **Marketing Team**: Primary users, need insights for campaign optimization.
- **Data Science Team**: Responsible for model development and maintenance.
- **Project Manager**: Oversees Agile sprints and ensures timely delivery.
